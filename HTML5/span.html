    <h3>Defiantion and Usage</h3>
    <p>
        The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

            The <span> tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute.

                The <span> tag is much like the element, but is a block-level element and <span> is an
                        inline element.
